# NEET Chess - Project CS160

**Objectives and Goals**

NEET Chess is a chess game application that allows one player or two players to play a traditional
game of chess on a digital platform. The primary objective was to create a fully functional chess
game with a user-friendly interface, accurate rule enforcement, and additional features such as
move validation, check/checkmate detection, and undo functionality. The project aimed to enhance
programming skills and demonstrate effective teamwork in building a complex application
